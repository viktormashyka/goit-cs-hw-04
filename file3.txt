3. From Venus and Adonis
"Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,
Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,
Statue contenting but the eye alone,
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!
Thou art no man, though of a manâ€™s complexion,
For men will kiss even by their own direction."
(Excerpt from a longer passage, trimmed for length.)
