4. From The Rape of Lucrece
"O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!
Or at the least this refuge let me find:
Though my gross blood be stain’d with this abuse,
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
That was not forc’d; that never was inclin’d
To accessary yieldings, but still pure
Doth in her poison’d closet yet endure."
(Excerpt from Lucrece's lament, trimmed for length.)
